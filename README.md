# 🧬 Seurat Preprocessing Shiny App

Welcome to the DR-scRNASeq! This app provides a user-friendly interface for performing various preprocessing and analysis tasks on single-cell RNA sequencing data using the Seurat package. Below is an overview of the workflows available in the app:

## 🚀 Features

### 1. 🗂️ Generate Your Seurat Object using **Upload and Convert**
   - **📂 Upload Your File**: Start by uploading your `.h5` or `.gz` file containing your single-cell RNA sequencing data.
   - **🔄 Convert**: Press the `Convert` button to convert your uploaded file into a Seurat object.
   - **💾 Download**: Once the conversion is complete, you can download the generated Seurat object for further analysis.

### 2. 🧪 Perform Preprocessing on Your Seurat Object using **Analyze and Process**
   - **📂 Upload Your .rds File**: Upload your existing Seurat object stored as an `.rds` file.
   - **⚙️ Specify Parameters**: Define the desired values and parameters for preprocessing, such as normalization, scaling, and filtering criteria.
   - **🔄 Process**: Click the `Process` button to execute the preprocessing steps on your data.
   - **💾 Download**: After processing, download the pre-processed Seurat object for dimensionality reduction or further analysis.

### 3. 📊 Perform Dimensionality Reduction using **Plot and Explore**
   - **📂 Upload Pre-Processed .rds File**: Upload the pre-processed Seurat object that you obtained from the previous step.
   - **🔍 Select Algorithm**: Choose the dimensionality reduction algorithm (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) you wish to apply.
   - **▶️ Run**: Press the `Run` button to perform the dimensionality reduction and generate visualizations.
   - **🔎 Explore**: Two tabs will appear, allowing you to explore the data through the generated plots.
   - **💾 Download Plots**: You will also have the option to download the plots for further analysis or presentation.
